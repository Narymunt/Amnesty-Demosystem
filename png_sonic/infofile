
    wow! we've encountered the cube!

    code - fremen
    music - inflex
    graphics - ginn

    coded on k6/300+rivaZX+32mb+sb16+gus, worked fine.
    no single asm instruction, very-very-very hurry on production
    without optimization
    better luck next time

    ah, about 50% of raytracing engine is based on Nugraf Okino sources.
    ...(nobody cares in fact)...

    we are very,very close to finish our gfx-engine on linux.
    however acceleration is working only on mandrake^redhat now.
    wait a little longer.

    see you later.
